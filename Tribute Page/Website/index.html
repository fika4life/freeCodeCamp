          <h3>SIMPLICITY, PATIENCE, COMPASSION</h3>
          <p>Life can get complicated quite easily, but sometimes all we need to do is get back to the basics. When feeling overwhelmed, these guidelines present essential rules in how to manage actions, relationships, and self-worth in a few, concise sentences.</p>
          <div class="quote">
            <span>“</span>
            <blockquote>Simplicity, patience, compassion. These three are your greatest treasures. Simple in actions and thoughts, you return to the source of being. Patient with both friends and enemies, you accord with the way things are. Compassionate toward yourself, you reconcile all beings in the world.”</blockquote>

        <h3>GOING WITH THE FLOW</h3>
        <p>This quote explains the concept of wu wei, uncontrived action or natural non-intervention. In life, rather than fighting against the conditions in our lives, we can allow things to take their natural course. This can also mean that when you don’t know what to do, do nothing. Instead, only jump at opportunities when you feel ready.</p>
        <div class="quote">
          <span>“</span>
          <blockquote>When nothing is done, nothing is left undone.”</blockquote>

        <h3>LETTING GO</h3>
        <p>Many Eastern philosophies remind us of the only true constants in life, change and death. While not an easy thing to do, accepting these facts of life can release you from as much suffering and bring freedom in life. We must remember to let go, and allow life to take its course.</p>
        <div class="quote">
          <span>“</span>
          <blockquote>If you realize that all things change, there is nothing you will try to hold on to. If you are not afraid of dying, there is nothing you cannot achieve.”</blockquote>

        <h3>HARMONY</h3>
        <p>The Chinese concept of yin and yang describes nature in daulities with two opposite, complementary, and interdependent forces. In other words, two halves balancing together that make a whole. Yin and yang always flows and changes with time. Examining and understanding these patterns in ourselves and around us brings more balance in life. For example, a person that becomes too rigid may break under pressure. Instead, they should become softer and more flexible to restore the balance of yin to yang.</p>
        <div class="quote">
          <span>“</span>
          <blockquote>Tao engenders One; One engenders Two; Two engenders Three; Three engenders all things. All things carry the yin (femininity) while embrace the yang (masculinity). Neutralising energy brings them into harmony.”</blockquote>

        <h2>Tao Te Ching</h2>

        <p>Tao Te Ching translates very roughly as “the way of integrity”. In its 81 verses it delivers a treatise on how to live in the world with goodness and integrity: an important kind of wisdom in a world where many people believe such a thing to be impossible.</p>
